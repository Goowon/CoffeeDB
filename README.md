# CoffeeDB
This project contains a Django App that allows users to filter and search for specific coffee beans for the perfect home roast. 
It takes a data file that I've webscraped that has information on coffee beans and puts it into a PostgreSQL database. I then
use django-tables2 and django-filters to display the dataset as a table and allow it to be filterable and sortable. I then 
wrote the HTML and CSS that would be used to display the two pages.
