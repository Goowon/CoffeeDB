Ethiopia Sidama ARDI,Coava Coffee Roasters,"Sweet and richly high-toned aroma: lemon, flowers, fresh-cut cedar, honey. Lushly bright acidity, medium body, silky mouthfeel. In the cup the lavish acidity registers first, followed by a softer impression of night flowers, lemon, and a cedar note that rounds toward cocoa. Extraordinarily long, resonant finish, deeply saturated with flavor.","['Fruity', 'Earthy/Herbal', 'Sweet', 'Chocolatey']","Portland, Oregon","['Lemon', 'Cedar', 'Honey', 'Cocoa']","Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia.",$10.00 / 250 g.

Sumatra Lake Tawar,Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters,"Intense aroma and flavor, dominated by one of the most distinctive notes in coffee, a kind of earthy, pungent citrus sensation that may suggest grapefruit to some, butterscotch to others, but essentially is a pleasure that belongs to this style of coffee alone. Complicated by flowering grass, nut, dark chocolate. Balanced, integrated acidity, silky mouthfeel, sweetly rich, resonantly flavor-saturated finish.","['Fruity', 'Chocolatey']","Olympia, Washington","['Grapefruit', 'Chocolate']","Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia",$14.50 / 16 oz.,April 2010,Medium,800-955-5282,www.batdorfcoffee.com
